# Radar Chart Visualization

This project demonstrates how to create a **Radar Chart** using Python, showcasing performance metrics of athletes, specifically football players. The chart is built through data manipulation using **Pandas** and custom visualization techniques.





## Overview

The Radar Chart is a powerful way to visualize multidimensional data, especially in sports analytics. In this project, we:

- Manipulate and prepare datasets with **Pandas**.
- Normalize and invert specific metrics for meaningful visualization.
- Create and customize the Radar Chart using Python libraries.





## Features

- **Dynamic Data Manipulation:** Filter and normalize datasets.
- **Customizable Visualization:** Adjust chart colors, labels, and styles.
- **Metric Inversion:** Support for metrics that require reversed scaling.
- **Football Analytics Example:** Pre-configured to visualize football player stats.
